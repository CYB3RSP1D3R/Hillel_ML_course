# Hillel_ML_course

This repository contains all Jupyter/Google Colab notebooks with homework projects. 

## Folder [HW2_NumPy](./HW2_NumPy/)

This homework contains warming-up exercises with NumPy.

## Folder [HW3_Pandas](./HW3_Pandas/)

This homework contains basic operations with Pandas tables.

## Folder [HW11_Clustering](./HW11_Clustering/)

This folder contains notebook with clustering algorithms experiment using 
[South German Credit dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/South+German+Credit+%28UPDATE%29).
Here three clustering algorithms and three metrics are compared. Also, this homework investigate the 
impact of dimension reduction level to clustering algorithms.

## Folder [HW15_MNIST_NN+CNN](./HW15_MNIST_NN+CNN/)

This folder contains notebook that compares performance of fully-connected neural network with convolutional neural network. Also, it contains script that finds the macro parameters of the networks.

## Folder [HW16_RNN](./HW16_RNN/)

The notebook in this folder contains a model that predicts whether the review from IMDB is positive or not. It contains two models, among which one model is pre-tokenized and without embedding; another one contains embedding and auto tokenization.

## Folder [HW17_Transformers](./HW17_Transformers/)

The notebook contains video content estimation algorithm using OpenAI model [CLIP](https://openai.com/index/clip/).

## Folder [HW18_RL](./HW18_RL/)

The notebook contains a RL-model for Minesweeper game using [Stable Baseline 3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html#) and [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)
